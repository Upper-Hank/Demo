## Introduction
Here are some demo ideas I had while learning front-end development
These demo techniques are basic and may some bug exist. Moreover, here is my first offical git repository (I learn a whole affter), and some operations don't seem to be that standardized.
However, I think this might not too bad for a start of long journey.
## 简介
这里是我学习前端过程中一些点子的demo。
这些demo的技术可能很基础，而且可能有bug。并且这也是我第一个git仓库（我整整学了一下午），有些操作看起来或许不那么正规的说。
不过，作为一个漫漫长路的起点，我想，这或许不算太坏。
